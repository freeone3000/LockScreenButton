# LockScreenButton
Simple Android application to assume Administrator permissions and lock the screen

This project was created when the power button on my phone broke. This application does one thing -- locks the screen when opened. For fun, add to your home screen.
I have no intention of publishing this to Google Play. Please sideload if you need it.
